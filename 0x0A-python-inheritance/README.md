* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a `superclass`, `baseclass` or `parentclass`
* What is a `subclass`
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type and super built-in functions`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
* All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

## Documentation
* Do not use the words import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
