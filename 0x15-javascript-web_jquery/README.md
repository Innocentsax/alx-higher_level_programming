# 0x15 Javascript - Web JQuery :roller_coaster:

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. This project covers Jquery and DOM events

## Learning Objectives :heavy_check_mark:

- Why JQuery make front-end programming so easy (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #ilovejquery :))
- How to select HTML elements in JavaScript
- How to select HTML elements with JQuery
- What are differences between ID, class and tag name selectors
- How to modify an HTML element style
- How to get and update an HTML element content
- How to modify the DOM
- How to make a GET request with JQuery Ajax
