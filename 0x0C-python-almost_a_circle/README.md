## Learning Objectives
![Obective](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRoCQNdvPIOxcgtvZNm61ilIzpAqg4i35ftGg&usqp=CAU)
+ At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

## General
+ What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
+ How to serialize and deserialize a Class
+ How to write and read a JSON file
+ What is *args and how to use it
+ What is **kwargs and how to use it
+ How to handle named arguments in a function
+ Copyright - Plagiarism
+ You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
+ You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
+ You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
+ Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### ___Python Scripts___
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
+ All your files must be executable
+ The length of your files will be tested using wc
+ All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
+ All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
+ All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
+ A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### ___Python Unit Tests___
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ All your test files should be inside a folder tests
+ You have to use the unittest module
+ All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
+ All your test files and folders should start with test_
+ Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
+ All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
+ You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
+ We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
